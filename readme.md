**LEVEL 1**

We need to create a program to manage the product catalog of a florist. At level 1, it handles persistence in a TXT file.

This program must meet the following requirements:

In a flower shop, which has a name, we have trees, flowers and decorations.

Each tree has a height.

Flowers have a color.

The decoration has one type of material: wood or plastic.

They all have a price.

A florist must have a stock of each of the products (trees, flowers and decoration).

The florist has a record of the total value of the stock it has.

A ticket class must be created, where purchases can be registered in ONE list.

As for the functionalities of the Main, at a minimum, it must include the following:

- Create Florist.
